# MAUS Public Roadmap

This document outlines the **public-facing roadmap** for **MAUS (Modular Autonomous Universal System)**.

It is intentionally **high-level and public-safe**.  
Detailed implementation plans, security models, and technical specifications are maintained separately.

---

## Guiding Philosophy

MAUS is built using a **layered scaling model**:

- **Fast interaction at the bottom**
- **Authoritative truth in the middle**
- **Final settlement at the top (Bitcoin)**

Progress prioritizes **correct architecture first**, then controlled expansion.

---

## Phase 0 — Vision & Architecture (Complete ✅)

**Status:** Completed

- MAUS system vision defined
- Core design principles established
- Layered architecture finalized:
  - MAUS Runtime Grid
  - MAUS Chain
  - Bitcoin settlement & anchoring
- Public-safe whitepaper published

This phase established the foundation and direction of the project.

---

## Phase 1 — Core Infrastructure Definition (Complete ✅)

**Status:** Completed

- High-TPS runtime model defined
- MAUS Chain snapshot model finalized (3–5 minute cadence)
- Validator model (permissioned v1) established
- Hourly Bitcoin anchoring strategy locked
- Public documentation boundaries defined

This phase ensures MAUS scales without compromising decentralization.

---

## Phase 2 — Identity, Accounting & Truth Layer (In Progress 🟡)

**Status:** In progress

Focus: **Who participates, what counts, and what is recorded as truth**

- Device / node identity model
- Admission control (pending / approved / revoked)
- Signed contribution reporting
- Internal contribution ledger
- MAUS Chain block structure and validation
- Time-layered truth snapshots

This phase enables safe participation by users, robots, and devices.

---

## Phase 3 — Subscriptions & Economic Access (Planned 🟠)

**Status:** Planned

Focus: **Sustainable access and revenue**

- Bitcoin-only subscription model
- Tiered access control
- Local enforcement with blockchain settlement
- Subscription state tracking via MAUS Chain
- Public auditability without real-time settlement overhead

This phase introduces economic sustainability without harming UX.

---

## Phase 4 — Rewards, Settlement & Payouts (Planned 🟠)

**Status:** Planned

Focus: **Fair distribution and settlement**

- Reward calculation from MAUS Chain summaries
- Scheduled Bitcoin settlement
- Payout batching and efficiency
- Separation of earning, accounting, and settlement

This phase completes the economic loop.

---

## Phase 5 — Validator Expansion & Decentralization (Future 🔵)

**Status:** Future

Focus: **Progressive decentralization**

- Expansion of MAUS Chain validator set
- Governance and participation policies
- Increased external verification
- Enhanced auditability and transparency

Decentralization grows as the system matures.

---

## Phase 6 — Ecosystem Growth & Applications (Future 🔵)

**Status:** Future

Focus: **Adoption and ecosystem development**

- Additional autonomous systems
- Developer tooling
- Visualization layers
- External integrations
- Community participation

MAUS becomes a platform, not just a system.

---

## Roadmap Notes

- Timelines are **intentional, not rushed**
- Architecture correctness is prioritized over speed
- Bitcoin is treated as a settlement layer, not an execution layer
- Public releases remain high-level by design

---

## Status Summary

- Whitepaper: **Public & Canonical**
- Architecture: **Locked**
- Core Infrastructure: **In progress**
- Economics & Settlement: **Planned**
- Decentralization: **Progressive**

---

**MAUS is built to last.**
