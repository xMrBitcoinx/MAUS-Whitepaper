# MAUS Whitepaper (v1)

**MAUS — Modular Autonomous Universal System**  
**Status:** Canonical public whitepaper  
**Classification:** Public-safe architectural overview  

---

## Abstract

MAUS (Modular Autonomous Universal System) is a layered, decentralized system designed to support high-throughput interaction, autonomous devices, and subscription-based access while anchoring truth and value to Bitcoin.

MAUS separates **interaction speed**, **authoritative truth**, and **economic settlement** into independent layers.  
This design enables large-scale participation and automation without sacrificing decentralization, auditability, or economic integrity.

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
Runtime interaction, system truth, and economic settlement are isolated into distinct layers with clear responsibilities.

### 2. Compression Over Throughput
High-frequency activity is aggregated and summarized rather than written directly to settlement layers.

### 3. Authority Down, Energy Up
Activity flows upward through the system.  
Final authority and settlement flow downward.

### 4. Bitcoin as Settlement, Not Runtime
Bitcoin is used exclusively for settlement, ownership, and immutable anchoring—not for real-time execution.

---

## System Architecture

MAUS is structured as a three-layer architecture:


Each layer is optimized for a specific function and timescale.

---

## Layer 1 — MAUS Runtime Grid

**Purpose:** Absorb all high-frequency activity.

**Characteristics:**
- 10,000 → 1,000,000+ internal events per second
- Fast, mutable, non-final
- Local enforcement of permissions and access

**Handles:**
- Users
- Robots and autonomous devices
- UI interactions
- Internal coordination and signals

This layer is optimized for speed and responsiveness rather than permanence.

---

## Layer 2 — MAUS Chain

**Purpose:** Record authoritative truth over time.

**Characteristics:**
- Time-layered snapshot ledger
- Snapshot cadence: **every 3–5 minutes**
- Append-only, ordered, auditable

Each MAUS Chain block represents a frozen slice of system reality.

### Canonical Block Contents

- Block height
- Snapshot time window (start / end)
- Previous block hash
- **Node summaries**
  - node_id
  - contribution type
  - total contribution
  - status
- **User summaries**
  - user_id
  - subscription state
  - permissions
- Merkle root
- Validator signatures

Raw runtime events never appear on the MAUS Chain.

---

## Validators (v1)

MAUS Chain validation begins as **permissioned**.

**Initial configuration:**
- 3 validators
- N-of-M signature requirement (e.g. 2-of-3)

**Validator responsibilities:**
- Verify identity integrity
- Validate contribution consistency
- Ensure correct snapshot timing
- Sign finalized blocks

Validators do **not**:
- Control runtime execution
- Manage funds
- Interact directly with robots or users

---

## Bitcoin Anchoring

**Anchor cadence:** Hourly  
**Anchored data:** MAUS Chain block hash or Merkle root  

Anchoring provides:
- Public auditability
- Irreversible history
- Trust minimization

Bitcoin never processes MAUS runtime activity directly.

---

## Economic Model

> **Robots earn. MAUS accounts. Bitcoin settles.**

### Device Identity

Each earning device is identified by:
- `node_id` — unique identifier
- `public_key` — signing identity
- `device_type` — robot | miner | pc | asic | other
- `status` — pending | approved | revoked

Only **approved** devices may contribute.

---

## Contribution Reporting

Devices submit signed contribution reports containing:
- node_id
- timestamp
- contribution type
- amount
- signature

Reports are verified and aggregated locally before being summarized into MAUS Chain snapshots.

---

## Internal Ledger

- Append-only contribution ledger
- Used for rewards, access control, and audits
- Periodically snapshotted into the MAUS Chain

This ledger is internal and does not perform settlement.

---

## Subscriptions

Access to MAUS resources requires an **active Bitcoin-paid subscription**.

**Enforcement model:**
- Enforced locally by the MAUS Runtime
- Bitcoin interaction occurs only at lifecycle boundaries

**Minimal subscription record:**
- account_id
- subscription status
- tier
- paid_until timestamp
- last Bitcoin transaction ID

---

## Settlement & Payouts

- Rewards are calculated from MAUS Chain summaries
- Bitcoin payouts occur on defined settlement intervals
- Devices and users never directly control settlement logic

---

## Public Scope & Disclosure

This document is intentionally **public-safe**.

### Included
- System architecture
- Economic flow
- Layered consensus model
- Bitcoin settlement philosophy

### Explicitly Excluded
- Cryptographic primitives
- Validator networking topology
- Key management
- Security procedures
- Deployment instructions
- Firmware or hardware control logic

### Companion Documents (Not Public)

## Conclusion

MAUS enables large-scale interaction and autonomous participation without overloading settlement layers or compromising decentralization.

By treating Bitcoin as the immutable settlement ceiling rather than the execution floor, MAUS achieves scalability, auditability, and long-term economic integrity.
