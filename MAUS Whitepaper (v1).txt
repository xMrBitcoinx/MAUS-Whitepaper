## Layer 1 — MAUS Runtime Grid

**Purpose:** Absorb all high-frequency activity.

**Characteristics:**
- 10,000 → 1,000,000+ internal events per second
- Fast, mutable, non-final
- Local enforcement of permissions and access

**Handles:**
- Users
- Robots / autonomous devices
- UI interactions
- Internal signals and coordination

This layer is optimized for **speed**, not permanence.

---

## Layer 2 — MAUS Chain

**Purpose:** Record authoritative truth over time.

**Characteristics:**
- Time-layered snapshot ledger
- Snapshot cadence: **every 3–5 minutes**
- Append-only, ordered, auditable

Each block represents a frozen slice of MAUS reality.

### Canonical Block Contents

- Block height
- Snapshot time window (start / end)
- Previous block hash
- **Node summaries**
  - node_id
  - contribution type
  - total contribution
  - status
- **User summaries**
  - user_id
  - subscription state
  - permissions
- Merkle root
- Validator signatures

Raw runtime events never appear on this chain.

---

## Validators (v1)

MAUS Chain validation begins as **permissioned**.

**Initial configuration:**
- 3 validators
- N-of-M signature requirement (e.g. 2-of-3)

**Validator responsibilities:**
- Verify identity integrity
- Validate contribution consistency
- Ensure correct snapshot timing
- Sign finalized blocks

Validators do **not**:
- control runtime execution
- manage funds
- interact with robots directly

---

## Bitcoin Anchoring

**Anchor cadence:** Hourly  
**Anchored data:** MAUS Chain block hash / Merkle root

Anchoring provides:
- Public auditability
- Irreversible history
- Trust minimization

Bitcoin never processes MAUS runtime activity directly.

---

## Economic Model

> **Robots earn. MAUS accounts. Bitcoin settles.**

### Device Identity

Each earning device has:
- `node_id` (unique identifier)
- `public_key` (signing identity)
- `device_type` (robot | miner | pc | asic | other)
- `status` (pending | approved | revoked)

Only **approved** devices may contribute.

---

## Contribution Reporting

Devices submit signed reports containing:
- node_id
- timestamp
- contribution type
- amount
- signature

Reports are verified and aggregated locally before being summarized into MAUS Chain snapshots.

---

## Internal Ledger

- Append-only contribution ledger
- Used for rewards, access control, and audits
- Periodically snapshotted into the MAUS Chain

This ledger is internal and non-settling.

---

## Subscriptions

Access to MAUS resources requires an **active Bitcoin-paid subscription**.

**Enforcement model:**
- Enforced locally by the runtime
- Bitcoin interaction only at lifecycle boundaries

**Minimal subscription record:**
- account_id
- subscription status
- tier
- paid_until timestamp
- last Bitcoin transaction ID

---

## Settlement & Payouts

- Rewards are calculated from MAUS Chain summaries
- Bitcoin payouts occur on defined settlement intervals
- Devices and users never directly control settlement logic

## Conclusion

MAUS enables large-scale interaction and autonomous participation without overloading settlement layers or compromising decentralization.

By treating Bitcoin as the immutable settlement ceiling rather than the execution floor, MAUS achieves scalability, auditability, and long-term economic integrity.
