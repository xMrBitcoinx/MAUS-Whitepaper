MAUS Whitepaper (v1)

Status: Public-safe architectural overview
Scope: Vision, architecture, and economic model
Excludes: Implementation details, cryptography specifics, security mechanisms, deployment instructions

Abstract

MAUS (Modular Autonomous Universal System) is a layered, decentralized operating environment designed to support high-throughput interaction, autonomous devices, and persistent user systems while anchoring truth and value to Bitcoin. MAUS separates interaction speed from economic finality, enabling scale without sacrificing decentralization or security.

Core Principles

Separation of Concerns
Runtime interaction, truth recording, and settlement are isolated into distinct layers.

Compression Over Throughput
High-frequency activity is compressed into periodic summaries rather than written directly to settlement layers.

Authority Down, Energy Up
Activity flows upward through layers; authority and finality flow downward.

Bitcoin as Settlement, Not Runtime
Bitcoin is reserved for settlement, ownership, and immutable anchoring only.

The MAUS Triangle Architecture
1. MAUS Runtime Grid (Bottom Layer)

High-TPS environment (10k–1M+ events/sec)

Handles:

Users

Robots / devices

UI events

Internal signals

Fast, mutable, local, non-final

This layer absorbs all transaction pressure.

2. MAUS Chain (Middle Layer)

Time-layered truth ledger

Snapshot cadence: every 3–5 minutes

Each block represents a frozen slice of MAUS reality

Records summarized state, not raw events:

Device contributions

User permissions

Subscription status

System integrity

Acts as the authoritative history of MAUS.

3. Bitcoin (Top Layer)

Global settlement and public finality

~10-minute block target

Anchors MAUS Chain history via cryptographic hashes

Bitcoin never processes MAUS runtime activity directly.

MAUS Chain Design
Block Contents (Canonical)

Each MAUS block contains:

Block height

Time window (start / end)

Previous block hash

Node summaries

node_id

contribution type

total contribution

status

User summaries

user_id

subscription state

permissions

Merkle root

Validator signatures

Validators (V1)

Permissioned validator set

Initial configuration: 3 validators

Consensus: N-of-M signatures (e.g. 2-of-3)

Validators verify:

Identity integrity

Ledger consistency

Time correctness

Signature validity

Validators do not control runtime or funds.

Bitcoin Anchoring

Anchor cadence: Hourly

Anchored data: MAUS block hash / Merkle root

Method: Bitcoin transaction (e.g. OP_RETURN)

Purpose:

Public auditability

Irreversible history

Trust minimization

Economic Model

Robots earn. MAUS accounts. Bitcoin settles.

Device Identity & Admission

Each earning device has:

node_id (unique)

public_key (signing identity)

device_type (robot | miner | pc | asic | other)

status (pending | approved | revoked)

Only approved devices may contribute.

Contribution Reporting

Devices submit signed reports:

node_id

timestamp

contribution type

amount

signature

Reports are verified and aggregated locally.

Internal Ledger

Append-only contribution ledger

Used for:

reward calculation

subscription enforcement

audits

Snapshotted into the MAUS Chain

Subscriptions

Access requires an active Bitcoin-paid subscription

Enforced locally by the runtime

Bitcoin interaction only at lifecycle boundaries

Minimal record:

account_id

subscription status

tier

paid_until timestamp

last BTC txid

Payouts & Settlement

Rewards calculated from MAUS Chain summaries

Bitcoin payouts occur on defined settlement intervals

Devices and users never directly control settlement logic

Public Scope & Disclosure
Document Classification

This whitepaper is intentionally public-safe. It describes MAUS at the level of architecture, principles, and economic flow only.

Included

System architecture

Layered consensus model

Economic structure

Bitcoin’s role as settlement

Explicitly Excluded

Cryptographic primitives

Validator networking topology

Key management

Firmware or hardware control

Security procedures

Deployment details

This separation follows best practices used by major infrastructure and blockchain projects.

Closing Statement

MAUS is designed to scale interaction without sacrificing decentralization by treating Bitcoin as the immutable settlement ceiling rather than the execution floor. This layered approach enables autonomous devices, subscription-based access, and long-term auditability while remaining economically and technically sustainable.

Status: Canon architecture locked. Implementation in progress.
