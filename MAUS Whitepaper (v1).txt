Implementation Status (v0.1.0 — Alpha)

Implementation Status Notice

As of v0.1.0 (Alpha), MAUS exists as a native Windows desktop application.
This release represents the first compiled, executable form of the MAUS system and is intended for architectural validation, interface experimentation, and iterative development.

The current implementation focuses on establishing a modular, visual-first desktop environment capable of supporting future extensions, plugins, and system-level experimentation. Functionality related to decentralization, 
Bitcoin-adjacent research, and user-controlled systems is exploratory in nature and not yet production-deployed.

MAUS is being developed incrementally, with this Alpha release serving as a foundation for future iterations rather than a finalized product. All concepts described in this document should be understood as evolving unless explicitly stated otherwise.
